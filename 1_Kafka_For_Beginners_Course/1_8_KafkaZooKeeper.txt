Kafka Zookeepers
====================================================================================    

    - Zookeeper is essentially a server
    - Zookeepers manages brokers (keeps a list of them)
    - Zookeeper performs broker leader election for partitions
    - Zookeeper sends notification to Kafka in case of changes
        - topic created / deleted
        - broker created / dies
    
    - Kafka 2.x cannot work without Zookeeper
    - Kafka 3.x can work without Zookeeper (using Kafka Raft instead)
    - Kafka 4.x will not have Zookeeper

    - There are odd number of Zookeepers by design (1, 3, 5 ... Zookeepers)
    - Zookeeper also has a leader (writes), the rest of the Zookeepers are followers (reads)
    - Zookeeper does not store consumer offsets (no consumer data)


    eg:

        Zookeeper 1 (server 1) (follower)
            - Broker 1
            - Broker 2
        Zookeeper 2 (server 2) (leader)
            - Broker 3
            - Broker 4
        Zookeeper 3 (server 3) (follower)
            - Broker 5

    
    * Previously, Producers, Consumers, Admin clients are all connected to Zookeeper
    * Now shifting towards direct connection to brokers instead of Zookeepers

    Problem:
        - Zookeeper is less secure that Kafka
        - Zookeeper ports should only be opened to allow traffic from Kafka brokers
        - Kafka Clients should not be allowed connection to Zookeepers

    * Modern day Kafka developer should never use Zookeeper as config in Kafka clients

====================================================================================
Kafka KRaft mode
====================================================================================   

    - Zookeeper has scaling issues when clusters > 100 000 partitions
    - By removing Zookeeper, Kafka can scale to millions of partitions
    - improves stability, makes it easier to monitor, support & administer
    - single security model for whole system
    - single process to start Kafka
    - faster controller shutdown & recovery

    * Production ready since Kafka 3.3.1
    * Kafka 4.0 will only support KRaft (no Zookeeper)
    * Kafka cluster should be launched in KRaft mode (instead of Zookeeper mode )


Kraft Architecture:
    - No Zookeeper
    - 1 Broker will serve as leader (Quorum leader)
